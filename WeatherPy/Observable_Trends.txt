Observable Trends (python-API-challenge)

1. Of the multiple weather metrics analyzed, only 'max temp' had a moderate to high correlation to the degrees of latitude of a given city.  Linear regression showed that max temperature shares a positive correlation to degrees of latitude in the southern hemisphere, and temperature shares a moderate to high negative correlation to degrees of latitude in the northern hemisphere.

2. Cloudiness might be subjective based on reporting city.  A great deal of data points demonstrate cities reporting 0% or 100% cloudiness on a given day regardless of the distance from the equator on latitude parallels.  The other data points are not as concentrated along 0% and 100%.  The random coordinates used for this exercise were uniformly distributed between -90 and +90 in degrees latitude and longitude.

3. Humidity and Wind Temperature do not seem to be tied to the city's latitude location from the equator.  The line regressions all had very small slope values and r squared values.
